## Guild

A turn-based RPG inspired by the team compositions of FFXIV and the class system of FFV/FF Tactics.

Prove your worth to the Guild's effort in stopping the ever-growing corruption of all nature by exploring dungeons, defeating monsters, travelling the world and recruiting members to fight for the cause.

Customize your characters through a job system with 12 different classes, allowing you to fight in which way you prefer and learn about their story and motivations.
